.. _onemkl_dft_compute_forward:

compute_forward
===============

This function computes the forward DFT(s), as defined by an instantiation of
the :ref:`descriptor<onemkl_dft_descriptor>` class, on user-provided data.

.. _onemkl_dft_compute_forward_description:

.. rubric:: Description

Given a successfully committed :ref:`descriptor<onemkl_dft_descriptor>` object
whose configuration is not inconsistent with forward DFT calculations, this
function computes the forward transform defined by that object.

The ``compute_forward`` function requires a successfully committed object of the
:ref:`descriptor<onemkl_dft_descriptor>` class and one, two or four "data
container" arguments (depending on the configuration of the
:ref:`descriptor<onemkl_dft_descriptor>` object). If using (pointers to) USM
allocations as data containers, this function may also be provided with an
``std::vector<sycl::event>`` object collecting dependencies to be observed by
the desired DFT calculations and return a ``sycl::event`` tracking the
progress of the DFT calculations enqueued by this function.

.. note::
   The compute_forward function may need to access the internals and
   private/protected members of the :ref:`descriptor<onemkl_dft_descriptor>`
   class.  This could be done, for instance, by labeling it as a friend function
   to the :ref:`descriptor<onemkl_dft_descriptor>` class.
